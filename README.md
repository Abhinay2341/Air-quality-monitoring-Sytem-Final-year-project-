# Air-quality-monitoring-Sytem (Final-year-project)

## Overview
The Air Prediction System is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor and predict air quality in real-time. It utilizes sensor data collected from various environmental sensors to analyze and predict air quality parameters such as pollutant levels, temperature, humidity, and more.

## Features
Real-time monitoring of air quality parameters.
Predictive modeling to forecast air quality trends.
Integration with IoT devices for data collection.
User-friendly web interface for visualization and analysis.
Customizable alerts for threshold exceedances.
Historical data storage for trend analysis and reporting.

## Technologies Used
Hardware: Arduino Uno R3, ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module, MQ135 Gas Sensor, DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
Software: Arduino IDE, Python, Flask, TensorFlow, HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
IoT Platform: ThingSpeak (or specify your chosen IoT platform).
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Chart.js.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Air Prediction System, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up the hardware components according to the provided schematics.
Upload the Arduino sketch to the Arduino Uno R3.
Install the necessary Python dependencies.
Run the Flask web application for data visualization and analysis.
For detailed installation and usage instructions, refer to the Documentation.
